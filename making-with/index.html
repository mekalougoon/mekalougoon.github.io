                    A project seeking to give agency back to the machine that is being used to design with. Drawing inspiration from Donna Haraway's concept of Sympoiesis, this project is designed to re-envision the relationship between technology and designer. This project challenges the principle of human agency.
                <br><br>Instead, both human and non-human actors will play an active role in the creative outcome. By acknowledging the inherent agency of technology and it's capacity to co-create, we aim to foster an environment where the resulting work is more conversational, open-ended, diverse and playful. This work is inspired by metamorphosis and change, allowing for dynamic new fors to appear without a prefixed form. These two posters explore human connection and the way that machines and algorithms create connections between us.</p>
