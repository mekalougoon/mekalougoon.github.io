                <p>Design and develop a series of dynamic posters within a continuously evolving content feed.<br><br>
                    A project seeking to give agency back to the machine that is being used to design with. Drawing inspiration from Donna Haraway's concept of Sympoiesis, this project is designed to re-envision the relationship between technology and designer. This project challenges the principle of human agency.
                <br><br>Instead, both human and non-human actors will play an active role in the creative outcome. By acknowledging the inherent agency of technology and it's capacity to co-create, we aim to foster an environment where the resulting work is more conversational, open-ended, diverse and playful. This work is inspired by metamorphosis and change, allowing for dynamic new fors to appear without a prefixed form. These two posters explore human connection and the way that machines and algorithms create connections between us.</p>

        <td>This project seeks to explore the way that technology creates connections between individuals, drawing connections to ways that this has been done in past, and how it is done now. Making With Text explores the ideas of connections between individuals and their demographics, presented in a way similar to how it may have been done years ago. Through newspaper advertisements of community groups or events, to highlight similarities between individuals.<br><br>

            Making With Images seeks to explore the same idea of connection, exploring the way that social media uses algorithms to connect content to users to form a curated feed for daily consumption. It explores the connection between abstract concepts.<br><br>
            Together, these posters show the way that technology digests, interprets and presents information that it collects about us to enrich our experiences in connecting with others and with the content displayed to us.</td>
        <td style="vertical-align: top;">I was strongly inspired by the idea of algorithms and how they form connections between posts and individuals to create feeds and match creators to their viewers. I did research into how these work, from how the use of keywords effect them, to the interactions of others, to things such as video length and audios used to influence the ideas for my two projects.<br><br>

            For visual style, I looked at old newspapers and community center adverts, because I liked the idea of this human elements and the older way of human connection. This included things like page colour, typefaces eg. decorative and bold, monospaced, etc.

                Throughout my background research, I liked the idea of blacked out text within books, and wanted to explore how this might look in a visualisation of this idea of connection. I tried a number of different layouts of the design, and while not shown here, considered how different typefaces might convey different contexts or ideas. Such an example is a more monospace font representing a computer process or algorithm, while a marker font like shown here might represent a community notice or flyer.

                        <li>Consideration of the number of elements of the leftmost design and making this more simple to not bring attention away from the main box, and considering a stronger tagline to drive the design.</li>
                        <li>Changing from a white background to a yellow background to mimic aged paper, and using a different font to convey this as well. Created a coloured legend, to move the focus away from a single person to the idea of connections between multiple people.</li>
                        <li>I decided to step back from the literal representation of the phone and the idea of watching, and decided to stay with the idea of connections being formed.</li>
                        <li>I made the background this same yellowed colour, and used older styled pointing fingers as arrows to tie it to the feeling of the text poster, despite the differences between the idea of the newspaper to social media.</li>
