I wanted to create a cohesive theme between my portfolio and my resume, so I drew upon elements that would be present. In this case, it was the arches and heading font that I would use.<br><br>
                            
                            I began by creating a low-fidelity wireframe of the website with the progression I thought it would have. Beginning at a landing page, it would scroll to show me as a person, then the role comparison of me as a designer and a developer, and as them individually. Having this design that I could refer back to when coding helped me greatly in achieving my design. <br><br>
                        
                        I then created the projects page, which I left blank as at the time I had little idea of how I wanted this to look. I wanted it to be heavily influenced by the design and elements of the rest of the site, which I set out to code first.</td>

                            <td>Once I decided upon the layout of my website, I then made decisions around my style. I wanted a font that would be loud and unique, while still remaining elegant. This let me to select 'ZT Shago'. I then selected Houschka Rounded for my secondary font, as it complemented the other nicely with its' curves and simple design. <br><br>I then looked to my colour palette. Knowing I wanted green as my central theme, I selected a light and dark based on a WCAG Colour Contrast and Accessibility test, to ensure that they were compliant. I then selected a light cream and a deep charcoal to complement these greens and add some variety, while keeping it neutral.</td>
