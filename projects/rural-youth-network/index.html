                    <h2>Brief</h2>
                    <p>When this proejct began, I helped with the original ideation of concepts around what this website could look like, and what it's purpose was. We decided upon a platform where Rural Youth could connect with like-minded individuals, to develop connections, build communities, and gain access to help and resources.<br><br> Initially, the development was outsourced to a development studio called Tech Studio. I worked with them as a liason, keeping track of project timelines and communicating the needs of our organisation. I developed some sections of the website and performed rigorous testing which I compiled into reports for fixing.<br><br>Once the platform had gained traction, we decided to do a major redesign and bring the development back in house for the sake of longevity. I worked with Rohan Gerrad to construct the new website, developing sections and again performing testing.</p>
