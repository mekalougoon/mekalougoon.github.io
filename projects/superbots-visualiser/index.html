                    <h2>Brief</h2>
                    <p>The Superbots Visualiser is a piece of technology designed to allow students to understand the relationship between a visualisation of a voicebot and their speech and how this can affect their communications. <br><br> Joining the development team after the base website was already complete, it was my role to add additional functionality and perform some bug fixes on the existing site. Currently, the highschool age students create a voicebot conversation using the software Fabella, then show their visualiser on a seperate screen. <br><br>The desired outcome was that the visualiser would be able to show different emotion states depending on where in the Fabella construct the conversation is, rather than by studentsâ€™ manual input, as was currently the case.

                        This will enable them to see more clearly the relationship between the visualisation and the communication, thinking more deeply about the connection between the two.</p>
