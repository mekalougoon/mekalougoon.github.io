                    <p>Today, I started at the mill, my first real job since Father’s accident. The machines are loud, so loud they drown out every thought in my head. My hands ache from feeding cotton through the spinning frames, and I barely had time to eat. But we need the coin, and with so many people coming to the city, there’s no rest for anyone.</p>

Part of me wonders if that means more work or no work at all. It’s unsettling, but for now, we keep on with our hands and feet, pushing these looms all day long.</p>

Still, I think, maybe this means something better is around the corner? Maybe there’s more out there for me, for all of us.</p>

Maybe we’re meant to build something better, not break it.</p>
