It has a narrow, flat snout, with defined markings between its head and the rest of its body on its small scales.<br><br>Its eyes are deep and reflective, and it moves with the shadows as it traverses its territory.

Normally overlooked, it moves quickly and silently, wings allowing it to swoop on unsuspecting mammals. An efficient and stealthy predator, it has large dark eyes adapted for nocturnal vision. It emerges during twilight hours to hunt its prey, but during daylight, remains dormant in the branches. This is the best time for sightings of this creature.<br><br>
                
                Due to its colour and mottled plumage, it's hard to see against its natural habitat, between branches and leaves. It is large, with long wings and a wide flared tail when provoked.</p></td>
